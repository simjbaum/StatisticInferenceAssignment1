# Statistic Inference Assignment 1
This repository is for the final assignment in the coursera course "Statistic Inference" from the John Hopkins University -
https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference/

There are two parts of the assignment
  1. Compare a simulated dataset with specified parameters to the theoretical distribution and values - a comparison of simulation vs central limit theorem
  2. Explore a public available dataset and statistically compare groups within the dataset - and show this graphically

In this repository you will find files for the two parts for the assignment in a rmarkdown file, html and PDF.

Part 1: Simulation Exercise Instructions

In this project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.

Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. You should

    Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
    Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
    Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

In point 3, focus on the difference between the distribution of a large collection of random exponentials and the distribution of a large collection of averages of 40 exponentials.



Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis Instructions

Now in the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

    Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
    Provide a basic summary of the data.
    Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
    State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
    
    


The review criteria:

Review criteria

    Did you show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to the theoretical center of the distribution?
    Did you show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution?
    Did you perform an exploratory data analysis of at least a single plot or table highlighting basic features of the data?
    Did the student perform some relevant confidence intervals and/or tests?
    Were the results of the tests and/or intervals interpreted in the context of the problem correctly?
    Did the student describe the assumptions needed for their conclusions? 



The Assignment is graded by peers of the course.
