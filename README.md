# Statistic Inference Assignment 1
This repository is for the final assignment in the coursera course "Statistic Inference" from the John Hopkins University -
https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference/

There are two parts of the assignment
  1. Compare a simulated dataset with specified parameters to the theoretical distribution and values - a comparison of simulation vs central limit theorem
  2. Explore a public available dataset and statistically compare groups within the dataset - and show this graphically

In this repository you will find the two parts for the assignment in a rmarkdown file.

The Assignment is graded by peers of the course.
