Part I - Compare the simulated exponential distribution to the theoretical values of the Central Limit Theorem
===============================================================================================================

Introduction
------------

In the first part of this assignment of the "Statistical Inference" class data will be generated by simulation. The simulated data will then be compared to its theoretical mean and variance based on the simluation parameters. The comparison will be graphically and by t.test. For more detailed instructions and guide lines see here: [assignment 1 - statistical inference - coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference/peer/3k8j5/statistical-inference-course-project)

__Data Simulation Parameter:__  

The __mean__ of the exponential distribution is __1/lambda__  
__lambda is 0.2__  
__40 exponential values will be generated to build one data point__  
__1000 simulations will be run in total__

simulation of the data
----------------------

``` r
set.seed(1)
mns_1000 <- c()
for(i in 1:1000){
    mns <- mean(rexp(n = 40,rate = 0.2))
    mns_1000 <- c(mns_1000, mns)
}

simMn <- mean(mns_1000)
varMn <- var(mns_1000)
```

theoretical mean and variance
-----------------------------

``` r
theoMn <- 1/0.2
theoVar <- (1/0.2)^2 /40
```

comparison of simulated and theoretical data
--------------------------------------------

``` r
library(ggplot2)
gplot <- data.frame(mns_1000)
m <- ggplot(gplot, aes(x = mns_1000)) + xlab("simulated mean")
m <- m + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour = "black", fill = "blue")
m + geom_density(colour = "red", size = 1) + geom_vline(xintercept = theoMn, color = "red", size =1) + geom_vline(xintercept = simMn, color = "black", size =1) + ggtitle("Histogram of simulated data") +  xlab("Value") + ylab("Density")
```

The data we generated follows a approximate normal standard distribution as shown by the histogram and the density indicated by the red line overlaying the data. Further, the red and the black line indicating the theoretical mean (red) and the mean of the simulated data (black). Both are almost similar indicating that the 1000 simulations are sufficient to create a good approximation to the theoretical mean.

statistical comparison between the theoretical and the simulated values
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 95% conf interval

``` r
simConfIntervl <- round( simMn + c(-1,+1) * 1.96 * sd(mns_1000)/sqrt(40),3)
theoretiConfIntervl <- round(theoMn + c(-1,+1) * 1.96 * theoVar/sqrt(40),3)

simConfIntervl
```

    ## [1] 4.748 5.232

``` r
theoretiConfIntervl
```

    ## [1] 4.806 5.194

The two 95% confidence intervals of the simulated (first value) and the theoretical values are compareable and close to each other.

### normal distribution

``` r
qqnorm(mns_1000)
qqline(mns_1000)
```

The correlation of the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution with the simulated quantiles we observe here supports the notion that the data we have generated is normally distributed.
